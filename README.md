MERN Authentication ApplicationThis project is a robust, full-stack authentication system built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It provides a complete user management solution with modern security features.Key FeaturesUser Registration & Login: Allows new users to create an account and existing users to sign in.Token-Based Authentication: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for secure, stateless user sessions.Email Verification: New users are required to verify their email address with a 6-digit code before gaining full access.Password Reset Flow: Includes a secure "Forgot Password" feature that sends a reset link to the user's email.Status and Development NotesThis application is currently in active development.Important Note on Email Functionality:For a professional and scalable solution, this application will eventually integrate with a live email service like SendGrid or Mailgun after acquiring a custom domain. Currently, due to the use of a development-only email sandbox, the application can only send emails to the developer's account, and not to any other email addresses.
